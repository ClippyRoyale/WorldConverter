WORLD CONVERTER CHANGELOG
(formerly Deluxifier)

Version 0.0 (Sep. 1, 2022): Preliminary version; based on sample world files.
    Converted worlds cannot be used in-game yet.

Version 0.1 (Sep. 30, 2022): Based on the newest private world 1 file.
  + Inserts default resources.effects (which wasn't in Legacy)
  + Deletes data only used in Legacy/Remake (e.g. layers, shortname)
  + Fixes relative resource URLs so they use Legacy sprites instead of
    glitched Deluxe ones
  - Removed insertion of resources.player (no longer part of DX world JSON)

Version 0.2 (Oct. 2, 2022):
  + Deletes objects that Deluxe doesn't support
      * The converter should now produce playable conversions for all worlds,
        though some features may be missing from newer worlds. I haven't
        tried it on every world yet, so please report any bugs/game crashes!
  + Better warnings if you try to overwrite an existing file
      * Basically went back to how it was in v0.0 but with a major bug fixed
  * Convert ALL obj sheets to the Deluxe default, not just Legacy default objs
  * Many more comments explaining how the code works
  + Jacob

Version 0.2.1 (Oct. 2, 2022):
  + Spinies are no longer deleted when converting
      * They got added back into Deluxe

Version 0.2.2 (Oct. 15, 2022):
  + Buzzy beetles are no longer deleted when converting
      * They got added back into Deluxe

Version 0.3 (Oct. 16, 2022):
  + Assets file is no longer deleted when converting
      * Side effect of fixing animation bugs
  + Add fallback assets if the world never had assets URL to begin with
    (e.g. if it's a remake world)

Version 0.4 (Oct. 18, 2022):
  + Converter now flags unsupported tile definitions and tries to degrade
    them gracefully

Version 0.5 (Oct. 23, 2022):
  + Auto-converts air damage and semisolid
  + Now distinguishes between incompatible tiles being replaced with fallbacks
    and tiles whose IDs just changed
  + Put framework in place for more compatibility checking to be added later
  * No longer deletes warp pipe left (slow and fast)
      * They got added back into Deluxe

Version 0.5.1 (Oct. 25, 2022):
  * Water standard is no longer deleted when converting
      * It got added back into Deluxe

Version 0.6 (Oct. 31, 2022):
  + Added ability to convert multiple worlds without having to restart program
  + Sound blocks added to Deluxe

Version 0.6.1 (Nov. 2, 2022):
  * Fixed crashes when converting a file without an assets.json link

Version 0.6.2 (Nov. 29, 2022):
  + Now supports Goombrats
      * They were added to Deluxe; not sure why a Legacy world would have the
        ID but if you add it in manually because you're using the Remake
        editor or something, they won't get taken out
  + Warning about anticheat false positives
  * Removes "vertical" metadata because Deluxe doesn't support vertical (yet)
  - Removed Jacob
      * Sorry, it took up too much space

Version 0.6.3 (Nov. 30, 2022):
  + No longer deletes gamemode

Version 1.0.0 (Dec. 16, 2022):
  + Added GUI
      * Based on the Skin Converter GUI
      * Helpfully colored blue so you can tell it apart
  + Added batch conversion (convert every world in a folder)
  * Increased stability when handling invalid files
  * Fixed loading of JSON files so converter can read files with byte order
    marks (e.g. Legacy hell1.json)
  * While the program itself is stable, it should still be treated as a
    public beta because Deluxe isn't out yet.

Version 1.1.0 (Dec. 20, 2022):
  + Converter now detects worlds already in Deluxe format
      * This used to make the converter crash, but now it just refuses to
        convert Deluxe worlds
  + Converts all "type" data to "game"
      * This makes converted lobbies playable
  + Supports new Deluxe tile defs:
      * 10: Solid Ice
      * 11: Note Block
      * 12: Item Note Block
      * 13: Ice -> Tile

Version 1.2.0 (Dec. 21, 2022): “The Layers Update”
  + Converter properly handles layers (which are now supported in Deluxe)

Version 1.3.0 (Dec. 25, 2022):
  + Updates levels to account for new water hitboxes, so water areas are 
    playable as intended (even if the conversion isn’t 1:1)
  - Removed checkpoints (they were either taken out of Deluxe or never added
    in the first place)
      * Thanks to Pyriel for helping me find this bug!

Version 2.0.0 (Jan. 8, 2023):
  + Added experimental De-Deluxifier for converting Deluxe levels to Legacy

Version 2.1.0 (Feb. 3, 2023):
  + App icon
  + UI improvements from Skin Converter
  + Supports new Deluxe objects: Cheep Cheep (underwater), Blooper, and Leaf
  * Now requires Pillow to display icons 
      * Offline users: use "pip3 install pillow" in your terminal

Version 2.2.0 (Mar. 1, 2023):
  + Deluxifier is now out of beta because Deluxe has been officially released!
  + Better map sheet URL expansion
      * Now converts URLs other than the standard smb_map
      * First tries the Legacy Github, then if that fails, tries Remake
  + New Deluxe tiles: flip blocks, item block regen & prog/invis,
    random warp tile, warp pipe up & single
  + New Deluxe objects: leaf, SMW goalpost
  + Vertical scrolling support
  * Deluxifier now requires the "requests" module. If you're running the offline
    version, please run the following command in your terminal:
        pip3 install requests
  - Removed Thwomps

Version 2.2.1 (Mar. 21, 2023):
  + Supports new Deluxe object: Hammer Suit
  * Interface updates from Skin Converter 5.0
      * Interface code is now basically the same in the two programs
      * More helpful bomb dialog that allows you to abort, retry, or ignore
  * Automatically detect if using Replit and enter fullscreen if so
  - Removed outdated disclaimers about MR Deluxe being in beta

Version 2.2.2 (Mar. 25, 2023):
  * Readded union type hinting in a way compatible with Py3.5+
  * Fixed interface bug that was breaking dialog boxes
  - Removed dialog()

Version 2.3.0 (Apr. 13, 2023): Emergency Hotfix
  + Message of the Day dialog displays a message I can customize on Github
      * May be used for emergency messages (e.g. bug warnings) or just news
  * Dialog box fix from Skin Converter

Version 3.0.0 (May 14, 2023): “The Database & Audio Update”
  + New main menu allows users to convert between Deluxe, Legacy, and Remake --
    or have the program automatically detect what version a world was made for
      * This is thanks to an improved tile database
      * Edge cases (e.g. conveyors) are handled better by the new database
      * Seriously, the old system was held together with duct tape
  + Legacy->Deluxe conversions now retain original audio
  * Updated the warnings screen
  - Removed Reverse Mode because the new system is more stable and flexible
  - Removed Herobrine

Version 3.1.0 (Jun. 24, 2023):
  + Added Rex to database
  + "Update available" header for MOTD if the message is about an update
  - Removed unnecessary sidebar from interface

Version 3.1.1 (Aug. 17, 2023):
  * Fixed conversion of free-roam levels
  * Fixed crash bugs that occurred when saving to a folder you aren't allowed
    to access
      * "Convert folder" option now saves to working directory instead of 
        subfolder of selected folder

Version 3.1.2 (Sep. 4, 2023 / OFFLINE ONLY):
  + PIL (pillow) and requests modules are now automatically installed if they
    aren't already installed on your computer
      * If you already have these modules installed, there's no need to update,
        as the program is otherwise unchanged
      * The program should now run out of the box without needing to install 
        those modules manually. Please tell Clippy if you have any issues!

Version 3.2.0 (Oct. 20, 2023):
  + Added option to convert world to work in both Legacy and Remake
      * Yeah I know, Remake bad, but this has been on my to-do list for a long
        time and it's one of the last Major Features I hadn't added yet.
  * Fixed fallback tile conversion
      * As it turns out, this had been completely broken since v3.0.0. The
        fallback code didn't activate at all, and if it did, it would've crashed
        the program. Whoops!

Version 3.2.1 (Oct. 27, 2023): The Warp Patch
  + Adjust position of warp ID 3 so you don't get warped out at the wrong 
    location in converted levels
  + Change warp IDs 5 and 6 (up-no-offset and down-no-offset) to 1 and 2
    in versions that don't have no-offset warps (i.e. Remake)

Version 3.2.2 (Nov. 26, 2023):
  * Fixed program logic errors that caused some tile fallbacks to be applied
    incorrectly (specifically, conveyors in R->D conversions)
  * App icon is now less blurry
  * Tweaked the yellow "!" warning icon
      * The other icons look the same but they've been losslessly compressed so 
        they take up less space
  - Removed Replit files from the GitHub
      * I’ve long since given up on Replit–GitHub integration
      * The source code is now named “deluxifier.py” instead of “main.py”
      * Just from the image compression, the size of the Deluxifier folder was
        reduced by 25%. With the Replit files removed, that goes up to 99.7%! 
        (68.4 MB -> 146 KB)
  - Removed third-party module installation requirements (PIL and requests)
  - Removed Herobrine

Version 3.3.0 (Mar. 11, 2024):
  + Reworked object database to address conflicts between Legacy & Deluxe IDs
  + Added objects from latest Legacy updates to database
      * Including: rotodisc, rex, cheep cheep, thwomp, path platform
  + Add flag objects to Remake levels that have flagpoles but no flags
      * Remake STILL doesn't even show flag sprites, but Legacy requires the
        flag object to exist for level completion to work properly
      * Converter will locate the flagpole top of the flagpole and place the 
        flag there
  * Renamed from "Deluxifier" to "World Converter"
  * Changed default settings from Auto->Deluxe to Auto->Legacy
  * Fixed Deluxe assets URL to point to GitHub instead of the now-deactivated
    live server
      * So yes, Deluxe levels will still be playable in Legacy or Remake if you 
        convert them (as long as they don't use Discord attachments)
  * Fixed UI refresh bug (the same one fixed in Skin Converter 7.2.0)
  * Code cleanup

Version 3.4.0 (Apr. 17, 2024):
  + Added new objects to Legacy's list: shell, drybones, goombrat, boo, firebro
  + Added new Legacy tiles: player/enemy barriers, half tiles
  + Legacy worlds can now use vertical and free-roam cameras
  + Added relative warp tiles to Deluxe database
      * Whoops, I forgot them this whole time
  + Item blocks containing a mushroom or fire flower are now converted to 
    progressive item blocks when converting to Legacy
      * For this reason, you can now convert "from Legacy to Legacy"
  * Vertical worlds in Remake now only set individual L/D zones to free-roam 
    if the zone exceeds the game's height limit
  * Improved detection of Remake vs. Legacy worlds
      * Fixed outdated netcode in version detection

Version 3.4.1 (Apr. 18, 2024):
  + Added special case for Legacy<->Deluxe cheep cheep color variants
  * Progressive item box conversion is now optional
      * Untick the box on the main menu if you want to leave item boxes as is
