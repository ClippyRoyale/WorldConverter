DELUXIFIER CHANGELOG

Version 0.0 (Sep. 1, 2022): Preliminary version; based on sample world files.
    Converted worlds cannot be used in-game yet.

Version 0.1 (Sep. 30, 2022): Based on the newest private world 1 file.
  + Inserts default resources.effects (which wasn't in Legacy)
  + Deletes data only used in Legacy/Remake (e.g. layers, shortname)
  + Fixes relative resource URLs so they use Legacy sprites instead of
    glitched Deluxe ones
  - Removed insertion of resources.player (no longer part of DX world JSON)

Version 0.2 (Oct. 2, 2022):
  + Deletes objects that Deluxe doesn't support
      * The converter should now produce playable conversions for all worlds,
        though some features may be missing from newer worlds. I haven't
        tried it on every world yet, so please report any bugs/game crashes!
  + Better warnings if you try to overwrite an existing file
      * Basically went back to how it was in v0.0 but with a major bug fixed
  * Convert ALL obj sheets to the Deluxe default, not just Legacy default objs
  * Many more comments explaining how the code works
  + Jacob

Version 0.2.1 (Oct. 2, 2022):
  + Spinies are no longer deleted when converting
      * They got added back into Deluxe

Version 0.2.2 (Oct. 15, 2022):
  + Buzzy beetles are no longer deleted when converting
      * They got added back into Deluxe

Version 0.3 (Oct. 16, 2022):
  + Assets file is no longer deleted when converting
      * Side effect of fixing animation bugs
  + Add fallback assets if the world never had assets URL to begin with
    (e.g. if it's a remake world)

Version 0.4 (Oct. 18, 2022):
  + Converter now flags unsupported tile definitions and tries to degrade
    them gracefully

Version 0.5 (Oct. 23, 2022):
  + Auto-converts air damage and semisolid
  + Now distinguishes between incompatible tiles being replaced with fallbacks
    and tiles whose IDs just changed
  + Put framework in place for more compatibility checking to be added later
  * No longer deletes warp pipe left (slow and fast)
      * They got added back into Deluxe

Version 0.5.1 (Oct. 25, 2022):
  * Water standard is no longer deleted when converting
      * It got added back into Deluxe

Version 0.6 (Oct. 31, 2022):
  + Added ability to convert multiple worlds without having to restart program
  + Sound blocks added to Deluxe

Version 0.6.1 (Nov. 2, 2022):
  * Fixed crashes when converting a file without an assets.json link

Version 0.6.2 (Nov. 29, 2022):
  + Now supports Goombrats
      * They were added to Deluxe; not sure why a Legacy world would have the
        ID but if you add it in manually because you're using the Remake
        editor or something, they won't get taken out
  + Warning about anticheat false positives
  * Removes "vertical" metadata because Deluxe doesn't support vertical (yet)
  - Removed Jacob
      * Sorry, it took up too much space

Version 0.6.3 (Nov. 30, 2022):
  + No longer deletes gamemode

Version 1.0.0 (Dec. 16, 2022):
  + Added GUI
      * Based on the Skin Converter GUI
      * Helpfully colored blue so you can tell it apart
  + Added batch conversion (convert every world in a folder)
  * Increased stability when handling invalid files
  * Fixed loading of JSON files so converter can read files with byte order
    marks (e.g. Legacy hell1.json)
  * While the program itself is stable, it should still be treated as a
    public beta because Deluxe isn't out yet.

Version 1.1.0 (Dec. 20, 2022):
  + Converter now detects worlds already in Deluxe format
      * This used to make the converter crash, but now it just refuses to
        convert Deluxe worlds
  + Converts all "type" data to "game"
      * This makes converted lobbies playable
  + Supports new Deluxe tile defs:
      * 10: Solid Ice
      * 11: Note Block
      * 12: Item Note Block
      * 13: Ice -> Tile

Version 1.2.0 (Dec. 21, 2022): “The Layers Update”
  + Converter properly handles layers (which are now supported in Deluxe)

Version 1.3.0 (Dec. 25, 2022):
  + Updates levels to account for new water hitboxes, so water areas are 
    playable as intended (even if the conversion isn’t 1:1)
  - Removed checkpoints (they were either taken out of Deluxe or never added
    in the first place)
      * Thanks to Pyriel for helping me find this bug!

    random warp tile, warp pipe up & single
  + New Deluxe objects: leaf, SMW goalpost

Version 3.0.0 (May 14, 2023): “The Database & Audio Update”
  + New main menu allows users to convert between Deluxe, Legacy, and Remake --
    or have the program automatically detect what version a world was made for
      * This is thanks to an improved tile database
      * Edge cases (e.g. conveyors) are handled better by the new database
      * Seriously, the old system was held together with duct tape

        as the program is otherwise unchanged
      * The program should now run out of the box without needing to install 
        those modules manually. Please tell Clippy if you have any issues!
