u_3.2.0 Version 3.2.1 of Deluxifier is now available! It features adjustments to warps in converted levels. No more popping out of a pipe and into a wall! Warp your way over to GitHub today to get the update.
u_3.0.0_3.1.0_3.1.1_3.1.2 Version 3.2.1 of Deluxifier is now available! It fixes a rather large bug involving fallback tiles that had the potential to break a lot of converted levels. I strongly recommend clicking the “View Update” version if you want a non-broken version of this app.
u_2.3.0 Version 3.2.1 of Deluxifier is now available! If you update, you’ll get improved functionality for converting Remake levels to Deluxe and converting Deluxe levels to older versions. It also allows some Deluxified levels to play correct audio. Visit https://github.com/WaluigiRoyale/Deluxifier/releases to get the update.
