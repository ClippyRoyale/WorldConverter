u_3.2.0_3.2.1 Version 3.2.2 of Deluxifier is now available! It fixes some level-conversion bugs, but more importantly, it takes up a lot less space on your computer. Like, A LOT less space.
u_3.0.0_3.1.0_3.1.1_3.1.2 Version 3.2.2 of Deluxifier is now available! It fixes a rather large bug involving fallback tiles that had the potential to break a lot of converted levels. I strongly recommend clicking the “View Update” version if you want a non-broken version of this app.
u_2.3.0 Version 3.2.2 of Deluxifier is now available! If you update, you’ll get improved functionality for converting Remake levels to Deluxe and converting Deluxe levels to older versions. It also allows some Deluxified levels to play correct audio. Visit https://github.com/WaluigiRoyale/Deluxifier/releases to get the update.
