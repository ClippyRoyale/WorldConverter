u_3.4.3 World Converter version 3.4.4 is now available, featuring database updates, i.e. the converter will recognize new objects from MR Legacy v6.0. (It's not an essential update but it's there if you want it.)
u_3.4.0_3.4.1_3.4.2 World Converter version 3.4.4 is now available, featuring improved Deluxe->Legacy world conversion (including background image support).
u_3.3.0 World Converter version 3.4.4 is now available! This update adds support for vertical levels and background images in Legacy.        (NOTE: The Replit version of the World Converter will stay on version 3.3 until further notice. Over the past year or so, Replit has become a slow AI-infested mess, and it's gotten to the point where I am literally unable to update my code because the page lags so much. I apologize for the inconvenience. Please message me on Discord if you know of any Replit alternatives that might work.)
u_3.2.0_3.2.1_3.2.2 World Converter version 3.4.4 is now available! You’ll need the update if you want to play Deluxe levels in Legacy now that MRDX has been taken down.
u_3.0.0_3.1.0_3.1.1_3.1.2 World Converter version 3.4.4 is now available! It fixes a rather large bug involving fallback tiles that had the potential to break a lot of converted levels. I strongly recommend clicking the “View Update” version if you want a non-broken version of this app. You’ll also need the update if you want to play Deluxe levels in Legacy now that MRDX has been taken down.

# 2.3.0 doesn't have a "View Update" button so I need to include the link
