u_3.2.0_3.2.1_3.2.2 Version 3.3.0 is now available! You’ll need the update if you want to play Deluxe levels in Legacy now that MRDX has been taken down.
u_3.0.0_3.1.0_3.1.1_3.1.2 Version 3.3.0 of Deluxifier is now available! It fixes a rather large bug involving fallback tiles that had the potential to break a lot of converted levels. I strongly recommend clicking the “View Update” version if you want a non-broken version of this app. You’ll also need the update if you want to play Deluxe levels in Legacy now that MRDX has been taken down.

# 2.3.0 doesn't have a "View Update" button so I need to include the link
u_2.3.0 Version 3.3.0 of Deluxifier is now available! If you update, you’ll get improved functionality for converting Remake levels to Deluxe and converting Deluxe levels to older versions. You’ll also need the update if you want to play Deluxe levels in Legacy now that MRDX has been taken down. Visit https://github.com/ClippyRoyale/WorldConverter/releases to get the update.
