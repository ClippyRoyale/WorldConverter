# Using ^ for newlines was added in 3.4.4, but the feature isn't currently necessary

u_3.3.0_3.4.0_3.4.1_3.4.2_3.4.3_3.4.4_3.4.5 World Converter version 3.4.6 is now available, featuring improved Deluxe->Legacy world conversion.
u_3.2.0_3.2.1_3.2.2 World Converter version 3.4.6 is now available! You’ll need the update if you want to play Deluxe levels in Legacy now that MRDX has been taken down.
u_3.0.0_3.1.0_3.1.1_3.1.2 World Converter version 3.4.6 is now available! It fixes a rather large bug involving fallback tiles that had the potential to break a lot of converted levels. I strongly recommend clicking the “View Update” version if you want a non-broken version of this app. You’ll also need the update if you want to play Deluxe levels in Legacy now that MRDX has been taken down.

# 2.3.0 doesn't have a "View Update" button so I need to include the link
u_2.3.0 World Converter version 3.4.6 is now available! If you update, you’ll get improved functionality for converting Deluxe levels to Legacy and Remake. You’ll also need the update if you want to play Deluxe levels in Legacy now that MRDX has been taken down. Visit https://github.com/ClippyRoyale/WorldConverter/releases to get the update.
