u_3.3.0 Version 3.4.0 is now available! This update adds support for vertical levels in Legacy, and it automatically adds progressive item blocks when converting levels to Legacy format.
u_3.2.0_3.2.1_3.2.2 Version 3.4.0 is now available! You’ll need the update if you want to play Deluxe levels in Legacy now that MRDX has been taken down.
u_3.0.0_3.1.0_3.1.1_3.1.2 Version 3.4.0 of Deluxifier is now available! It fixes a rather large bug involving fallback tiles that had the potential to break a lot of converted levels. I strongly recommend clicking the “View Update” version if you want a non-broken version of this app. You’ll also need the update if you want to play Deluxe levels in Legacy now that MRDX has been taken down.
