u_3.4.0 Version 3.4.1 is now available, featuring bug fixes and an option to turn off the automatic progressive item box conversion from the last update. Smash that “View Update” button, subscribe and ring the bell, etc.
u_3.3.0 Version 3.4.1 is now available! This update adds support for vertical levels in Legacy, and it automatically adds progressive item blocks when converting levels to Legacy format.        (NOTE: The Replit version of the World Converter will stay on version 3.3 until further notice. Over the past year or so, Replit has become a slow AI-infested mess, and it's gotten to the point where I am literally unable to update my code because the page lags so much. I apologize for the inconvenience. Please message me on Discord if you know of any Replit alternatives that might work.)
u_3.2.0_3.2.1_3.2.2 Version 3.4.1 is now available! You’ll need the update if you want to play Deluxe levels in Legacy now that MRDX has been taken down.
u_3.0.0_3.1.0_3.1.1_3.1.2 Version 3.4.1 of Deluxifier is now available! It fixes a rather large bug involving fallback tiles that had the potential to break a lot of converted levels. I strongly recommend clicking the “View Update” version if you want a non-broken version of this app. You’ll also need the update if you want to play Deluxe levels in Legacy now that MRDX has been taken down.

# 2.3.0 doesn't have a "View Update" button so I need to include the link
u_2.3.0 Version 3.4.1 of Deluxifier is now available! If you update, you’ll get improved functionality for converting Remake levels to Deluxe and converting Deluxe levels to older versions.
