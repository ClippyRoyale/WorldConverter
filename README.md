# MR World Converter

Source code and documentation copyright (C) 2022â€“2024 ClippyRoyale

## What is this?

This is a Python program designed to convert Mario Royale worlds between formats used by different versions of the game (for example, to make MR Deluxe worlds playable in MR Legacy/Remake). You can play converted worlds as-is, or use them as a starting point to make a world more consistent with Deluxe's visual style.

## How do I use it?

1. Install Python at https://python.org if you haven't already.
2. Click the Releases button in the right sidebar and download the source code.
3. Unzip the file you just downloaded.
4. Double-click WorldConverter.py to open the code in IDLE.
5. Go to the Run menu and click Run Module.
6. Enjoy!

There used to be an online version (via Replit), but that site has become so laggy that I literally cannot release updates over there anymore. That version will remain online for now, but it'll be stuck on version 3.3. I will not provide any support for that version, but if you absolutely must use it (e.g. if you're on a school computer and you can't install software), here's the link: https://replit.com/@WaluigiRoyale/Deluxifier

## System Requirements
This program doesn't have a very attractive interface. This is because I'd rather spend my time making the program *work*. In fact, it'll work on basically any operating system released in the last 15 years.

The program should run on any operating system that can run Python 3.5 (though I've only tested it as far back as Python 3.7):
* MacOS 10.5 or later
* Windows Vista or later

You should also be able to use it on Linux (including Chrome OS) as well, but there are too many variations of that for me to provide any guarantees.

The online version ran on anything that could run a modern web browser (including Windows XP or later, MacOS 10.7 or later, Linux, Chromebooks, and smartphones).
