## What is this?

This is a Python program designed to convert MRoyale Legacy worlds to the updated MRoyale Deluxe format. The lead developers of Deluxe have said they will not officially support Legacy worlds in Deluxe, but the world formats are similar enough that this converter can provide semi-official community support for playing the old worlds in the new game. You can play converted worlds as-is, or use them as a starting point to make a world more consistent with Deluxe's visual style.

## How do I use it?

There are two main ways to run this program:

1. On your computer. The app will run faster and look better but some programming experience is recommended. You’ll need to install Python. If you aren’t allowed to install programs on your computer (e.g. because it’s a school computer), try option 2...
2. Online with Replit. This method is a little clunkier but it’s more beginner-friendly and supports basically any device, including Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebooks, Android, and iOS. Link: https://replit.com/@WaluigiRoyale/Deluxifier

## System Requirements
This program doesn't have a very attractive interface. This is because I'd rather spend my time making the program *work*. In fact, it'll work on basically any operating system released in the last 15 years.

The online (Replit) version will work on any operating system that can run a modern web browser:
* MacOS 10.7 or later
** MacOS 10.12– : Use Firefox
** MacOS 10.7–10.11: Use Chromium Legacy
* Windows 7 or later (Firefox)

If you download the source code from this Github project's Releases, it will run on any operating system that can run Python 3.5:
* MacOS 10.5 or later
* Windows Vista or later

You should also be able to use it on Linux (including Chrome OS), but there are too many variations of that for me to provide any guarantees.

## Troubleshooting

### I can’t get it to run! All I see is a blank screen!

Try clicking “Stop” then clicking “Run” again. If that doesn’t work, clear your cache ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

### I downloaded the code, and when I run the program, it's in fullscreen!

This was a problem back when there were two different Online and Offline versions, but not anymore because there's only one version now. Please download the newest version from the "Releases" section in the sidebar.
