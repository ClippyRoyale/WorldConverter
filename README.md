# MR World Converter

## What is this?

This is a Python program designed to convert Mario Royale worlds between formats used by different versions of the game (for example, to make MR Deluxe worlds playable in MR Legacy/Remake). You can play converted worlds as-is, or use them as a starting point to make a world more consistent with Deluxe's visual style.

## How do I use it?

1. Install the latest version of Python at https://python.org if you don’t have it already.
2. Download the source code at https://github.com/ClippyRoyale/SkinConverter/releases/latest (click on “Source code (zip)” in the Assets section).
3. Unzip the file you just downloaded.
4. Double-click “WorldConverter.py” to open the code in IDLE.
5. Go to the Run menu and click Run Module.
6. Enjoy!

If you’re unable to install Python or download the source code (e.g. because you’re on a school computer), there is also a deprecated online version (based on v3.4.5) hosted on Replit. I am no longer updating it, but I’ve kept it online as a last-resort option. This program is provided AS IS. Please do not expect me to provide any troubleshooting or bug fixes.

## System Requirements
This program doesn't have a very attractive interface. This is because I'd rather spend my time making the program *work*. In fact, it'll work on basically any operating system released in the last 15 years.

The program should run on any operating system that can run Python 3.5 (though I've only tested it as far back as Python 3.7):
* MacOS 10.5 or later
* Windows Vista or later

You should also be able to use it on Linux (including Chrome OS) as well, but there are too many variations of that for me to provide any guarantees.

The online version ran on anything that could run a modern web browser (including Windows XP or later, MacOS 10.7 or later, Linux, Chromebooks, and smartphones).
